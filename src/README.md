### Arduino Source Code

These are the Arduino files needed for the project.  Note that you need the desk_amp.ino file, plus the Credentials.h and Settings.h files.  The Credentials.h file **must be edited** with your wifi and MQTT information.  There are other requirements for the Arduino environment, including the ESP32 board add-on and other libraries.

It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you review the information in the [wiki pages](https:/Resinchem/Arylic-Amp-MQTT/wiki) carefully.  Different firmware revisions of the amp, or different build options may require other modifications to the code.

### This code is being provided "as-is" and is meant to serve as a framework for your own project and not as a plug-and-play solution!

I've provided as much documentation in the wiki and via comments in the code, but you should have some experience working with the Arduino code and should expect to make some modifications for your particular project.  I will be happy to answer questions posted in the discussion area, but will not be addressing or fixing any issues reported for other amp versions or firmware... or for builds that differ from mine.
