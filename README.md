The Arylic DIY Up2Stream Amp has convenient interfaces that allow you to add controls such as a volume knob and push buttons for some features.  But it also offers a UART inteface.  By adding an ESP32, this UART can be used to communication MQTT topics to and from the amp.  In addition, the ESP32 adds some addtional features that are either separate purchases or are simply not available otherwise.
